# Prayer Times Node.js App

Prayer Times is ment to be a self hosted Prayer times app for muslims. For non-muslims you can think of it as an alarm that runs five times a day depending on today's prayer times.

The app is still under development and more features are to be added.

The app uses aladhan.com api to recieve prayer times.

Right now the main function runs you just need to:
1. Change the location in utility/fetchPrayerTimes.js
2. install node.js
3. install required node modules using:

```bash
npm i
```

4. run the app using:

```bash
node app.js
```
